Getting donation for project

docker build -t your-username/user-service:your-image-tag user-service
docker push your-username/user-service:your-image-tag

# Repeat the above steps for order-service and payment-service

kubectl apply -f user-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f user-service-service.yaml

# Repeat the above steps for order-service and payment-service YAMLs


kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

Use Kubernetes Service DNS Names: Each Kubernetes Service gets its own DNS name. The format for accessing a service within the same namespace is <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local. So, for example, if both user-service and order-service are in the same namespace, user-service can communicate with order-service using the DNS name order-service.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local.

HTTP Requests: If your microservices communicate over HTTP, you can use the DNS name as the URL. For example, in your user-service code, when making an HTTP request to the order-service, you would use http://order-service.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>/endpoint.

Environment Variables: You can also use environment variables to specify the URLs of other services dynamically. Kubernetes automatically injects environment variables containing the service names and ports for each service.
